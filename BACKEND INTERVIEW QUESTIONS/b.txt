Q1=> What is Caching? How can you save money with Caching?
Ans=> The data in a cache is generally stored in fast access hardware such as RAM (Random-access memory)
      and may also be used in correlation with a software component. A cache's primary purpose is to increase
      data retrieval performance by reducing the need to access the underlying slower storage layer.

Q2=> What is load balancing?
Ans=> Load balancing is the process of distributing network traffic across multiple servers.
      This ensures no single server bears too much demand.  

Q3=> What is CAP Theorem?
Ans=> The CAP theorem states that a distributed system cannot simultaneously be consistent, available, and partition tolerant.      

Q4=> What is Eventual Consistency?
Ans=> Eventual consistency is a characteristic of distributed computing systems such that the value for a specific data item will,
      given enough time without updates, be consistent across all nodes.

Q5=> What is Strong Consistency?
Ans=> Strong consistency is one of the consistency models used in the domain of concurrent programming (e.g., in distributed shared memory,
      distributed transactions). The protocol is said to support strong consistency if: All accesses are seen by all parallel processes (or nodes, processors, etc.)

Q6=> What are the different types of databases?
Ans=> Centralised database.
      Distributed database.
      Personal database.
      End-user database.
      Commercial database. 
      NoSQL database.
      Operational database.
      Relational database.

Q7=> What is Message queues?
Ans=> Message queues allow different parts of a system to communicate and process operations asynchronously.        

Q8=> What is Pub Sub ?
Ans=> Publish/subscribe messaging, or pub/sub messaging, is a form of asynchronous service-to-service communication used in serverless and microservices architectures. 
      In a pub/sub model, any message published to a topic is immediately received by all of the subscribers to the topic.

Q9=> What are webhooks?
Ans=> A webhook is a lightweight API that powers one-way data sharing triggered by events. Together, they enable applications to share data and functionality, and turn 
      the web into something greater than the sum of its parts.  

Q10=> What is Docker? Why do we use it?
Ans=> Docker is an open source containerization platform. It enables developers to package applications into containers—standardized executable components combining application
      source code with the operating system (OS) libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment. 

Q11=> What is S3 Service in AWS?
Ans=> Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. You can use
      Amazon S3 to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time, from anywhere. 

Q12=> What is EC2 Instance in AWS?
Ans=> Amazon EC2 provides a wide selection of instance types optimized to fit different use cases. Instance types comprise varying combinations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking 
      capacity and give you the flexibility to choose the appropriate mix of resources for your applications.       

Q13=> What is Cloudfront in AWS?
Ans=> Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service built for high performance, security, and developer convenience.

Q14=> What is Route 53 In AWS?
Ans=> Amazon Route 53 effectively connects user requests to infrastructure running in AWS – such as Amazon EC2 instances, Elastic Load Balancing load balancers, or Amazon S3 buckets – and
      can also be used to route users to infrastructure outside of AWS.

Q15=> What are ELBs in AWS?
Ans=> Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets and virtual appliances in one or more Availability Zones (AZs).

Q16=> What is TLS?
Ans=> Transport Layer Security, or TLS, is a widely adopted security protocol designed to facilitate privacy and data security for communications over the Internet

Q17=> What is the difference HTTPS vs HTTP?
Ans=> HTTPS is HTTP with encryption. The only difference between the two protocols is that HTTPS uses TLS (SSL) to encrypt normal HTTP requests and responses. As a result, HTTPS is far more secure than HTTP.
      A website that uses HTTP has http:// in its URL, while a website that uses HTTPS has https://.

Q18=> What is a reverse proxy?
Ans=> A reverse proxy server is a type of proxy server that typically sits behind the firewall in a private network and directs client requests to the appropriate backend server. A reverse proxy provides an additional
     level of abstraction and control to ensure the smooth flow of network traffic between clients and servers.
